# bb-events-cal-helpers
At the moment, a number of Events Calendar Pro-specific modules are present in Beaver Themer, but others needed for setting up Themer Layouts are not present. These shortcodes can be placed in Text or HTML modules in a singular Themer Layout to avoid needing supplementary theme files.

## Singular Organizer View
* `[bdd_event_single_organizer_list]` will output the feed of events associated with the organizer that is present in the default single organizer view.

## Singular Venue View
* `[bdd_event_single_venue_list]` will output the feed of events associated with the venue.
* `[bdd_event_single_venue_info]` will output the address, phone number, and website of the venue.
